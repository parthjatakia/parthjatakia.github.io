Namaste ! Greetings !

I am a Ph.D. candidate at **Princeton University** in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I work in Professor Andrew Houck's group ([lab website](https://houcklab.princeton.edu/)) on **superconducting qubits**. We work on the **complete stack** of challenges in the quantum world ; from **improving the coherence** of the qubit to deploying qubits for **simulating novel dynamics**. 

I work on the **coherence challenge** and tackle it in a multi-pronged way. Firstly, by implementing complex circuit designs such as **fluxonium, zero-pi** that show inherent protection from noisy environment. Secondly, by utilizing new superconducting material called **tantalum** which has better oxide properties that improves the qubit coherence. Thirdly, by creating **novel circuit elements** which demonstrate protective hamiltonians against the noisy decoherence channels.

### Background : 
I did my **Bachelors** and **Masters** in Engineering Physics from **Indian Institute of Bombay** with specialization in Nanoscience and a minor degree in Computer Science. If you are curious and want to know more about me, then you can find it here - [my CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
