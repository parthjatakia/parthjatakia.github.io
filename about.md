![Me]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/myphoto.jpg){:width="400px"}

Welcome! I am Parth Jatakia.

As the name of the blog would suggest, I am interested in anything related to quantum. I am excited about developing theory, components and tools that will hopefully one day be crucial for building revolutionary quantum technologies. I am planning to work on such problems statements during my PhD. This website's purpose is partially for showcasing and partially for documenting this journey of learning, building and tinkering with everything related to quantum.

If you are curious and want to know more about me, then you can find it here - [my CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
