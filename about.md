![Me]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/myphoto.jpg){:width="300px"}

Namaste ! Greetings !

I am a Ph.D. candidate at **Princeton University** in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I work in Professor Andrew Houck's group ([lab website](https://houcklab.princeton.edu/)) on _superconducting qubits_. 

We work on the complete stack of challenges in the quantum world ; from improving the coherence of the qubit to deploying qubits for simulating novel dynamics. 


If you are curious and want to know more about me, then you can find it here - [my CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
