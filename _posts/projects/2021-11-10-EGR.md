summary : "The main aim was on fabricating double quantum dots in Si/SiGe heterostructure. This mainly involved extensive process optimization from ground-up as few processes were being done for the first time at IIT Bombay. Apart from fabrication, I have also simulated the quantum dot architecture using Schr√∂dinger-Poissn Solver."
